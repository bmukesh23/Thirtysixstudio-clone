# üå∂Ô∏è Thirtysixstudio clone
A ThirtysixStudio Clone Website, developed to demonstrate my proficiency in GSAP animations and create an interactive, minimalistic, and visually appealing website. The key feature of this project is an engaging user experience, where clicking the "ThirtysixStudio" text triggers the appearance of 3D elements and dynamic effects. These transitions are brought to life by randomly swapping 2D images, enhancing the overall smooth scrolling and animation effects. The project serves both as a showcase of my skills and a learning exercise in creating modern, interactive web designs.
